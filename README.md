# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Eat-Da-Burger is a full stack application with the front end implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the back end with Node.js and Express. Data is stored in a MySQL database. HTML templating is done handled with the use of Handlebars.
